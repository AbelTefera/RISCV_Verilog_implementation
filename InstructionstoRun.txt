**Details**

-> Verilog File Name: riscv.v
-> Test Bench is located at line 48 with top module called in it at line 93.

1. Instruction memory is loaded from a file name iMem.txt at line 122 with default location in E:\ drive. An example code written in hexadecimal is placed in the iMem.txt file. The details of the example code are written in the end.
The instruction memory is located at path = riscv.iMem.ram

2. Dmemory is loaded from a file name dMem.txt at line 538 with default location in E:\ drive. An example data written in hexadecimal is placed in the dMem.txt file. 
The instruction memory is located at path = riscv.dMem.ram

3. Register file is located at path = riscv.registerMem.registers
