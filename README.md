# RISC-V Implementation in Verilog
RISC-V is implemented in Verilog using Intel Quartus Prime for compilation and Icaraus Verilog for simulation. The code is pipelined but not every instruction is implemented.

### Note
The instructions on how to use this verilog file is in InstructiontoRun.txt file
